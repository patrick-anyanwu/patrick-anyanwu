<b>Hey there</b> 👋

I'm Patrick, a data scientist and engineer based in Australia.

I mostly work on data and analytics — Python, SQL, Power BI/Tableau, Databricks, and a bit of frontend with Figma and React when I’m building dashboards or prototypes. I also work on cloud-based data warehousing & orchestration using Microsoft Fabric.


This is a fresh profile where I’ll be uploading analytics projects, experiments, and things I’m currently working on.

<b>A Bit About Moi</b>

🧩 I enjoy designing and building things — dashboards, apps, systems, anything

🥤 I draw occasionally, (trying to publish my own comic someday...)
